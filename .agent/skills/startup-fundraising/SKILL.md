### Example 3: Term Sheet Comparison

```markdown
TERM SHEET COMPARISON
───────────────────────────────────────────

                    VC Fund A       VC Fund B       Angel Group
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Investment          $2M             $1.5M           $750K
Pre-money           $8M             $6M             $5M
Post-money          $10M            $7.5M           $5.75M
Founder dilution    20%             20%             13%
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Liquidation Pref    1x non-part     1x participating 1x non-part
Board seats         1 VC + 2 founders 2 VC + 1 founder 0 (observer)
Pro-rata            Yes             Yes             Yes
Option pool         15% (new)       20% (new)       10% (existing)
Anti-dilution       Broad weighted  Full ratchet ⚠️ Broad weighted
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

RECOMMENDATION: VC Fund A
- Better board control (2 founder seats)
- Standard anti-dilution (not full ratchet)
- Reasonable option pool ask
- Non-participating preferred (founder-friendly exit)

NEGOTIATE: Try to reduce option pool to 12-15%
```

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do This

- ✅ Start fundraising when you don't desperately need it
- ✅ Create urgency with parallel conversations
- ✅ Get warm intros whenever possible
- ✅ Update investors consistently (even on bad news)
- ✅ Know your numbers cold
- ✅ Reference-check investors with founders
- ✅ Negotiate key terms (board, option pool)
- ✅ Have a BATNA (walk-away option)
- ✅ Keep building while fundraising
- ✅ Use advisors/lawyers for term sheet review

### ❌ Avoid This

- ❌ Don't raise when desperate (bad terms)
- ❌ Don't spray-and-pray with cold emails
- ❌ Don't share confidential info before term sheet
- ❌ Don't accept first term sheet without comparison
- ❌ Don't give up too much board control
- ❌ Don't ignore anti-dilution provisions
- ❌ Don't take money from bad-fit investors
- ❌ Don't lie about metrics (it always comes out)
- ❌ Don't stop running the business to fundraise

## Fundraising Metrics to Track

```
FUNDRAISING FUNNEL METRICS
├── Investors contacted: [Total]
├── Meetings booked: [X%]
├── Partner meetings: [X%]
├── Term sheets received: [X]
├── Term sheet to close: [X%]
└── Average time to close: [X weeks]

HEALTHY BENCHMARKS:
- 50-100 investors contacted
- 30-50 first meetings
- 10-20 partner meetings
- 2-3 term sheets
- 3-6 months total process
```

## Common Pitfalls

**Problem:** Can't get meetings with VCs
**Solution:** Focus on warm intros. If 70%+ cold → build more relationships before raising.

**Problem:** Meetings but no second meetings
**Solution:** Pitch isn't resonating. Get feedback. Adjust story. Practice more.

**Problem:** One term sheet, feeling pressured
**Solution:** Don't sign immediately. Buy time. Try to generate competitive terms.

**Problem:** Fundraising taking too long, running out of runway
**Solution:** Consider bridge from existing investors. Cut burn. Reconsider round size/timing.
