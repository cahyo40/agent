## Overview

## When to Use This Skill

- Use when creating YouTube Shorts
- Use when optimizing short-form content
- Use when growing YouTube channel
- Use when repurposing content for Shorts

## How It Works

### Step 1: Shorts Specifications

```
TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
├── Aspect Ratio: 9:16 (vertical)
├── Duration: 15-60 seconds (sweet spot: 30-45s)
├── Resolution: 1080 x 1920 pixels
├── Upload: Use #Shorts in title/description
└── Auto-detect: Upload any vertical <60s
```

### Step 2: Content Strategy

| Type | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Tutorial Shorts | Authority | "How to X in 30 seconds" |
| Hook + Payoff | Retention | "Wait until the end..." |
| Trending Audio | Discovery | Use popular sounds |
| Behind-Scenes | Connection | Process/workspace |
| Clip Full Video | Funnel | Best moments |

### Step 3: Structure for Retention

```
RETENTION FORMULA
─────────────────────────────────
HOOK (0-3 sec)
├── Start mid-action or statement
├── Text overlay with value prop
├── Promise payoff
└── "Don't skip this..."

BODY (3-50 sec)
├── Deliver value immediately
├── No slow builds
├── Keep visual movement
├── Text on screen

LOOP/PAYOFF (Last 5 sec)
├── Surprise or satisfying ending
├── Seamless loop potential
└── "Follow for part 2"
```

### Step 4: Algorithm Optimization

```
YOUTUBE SHORTS ALGORITHM
├── Watch Time % (most important)
├── Likes, comments, shares
├── Subscribe after watching
├── Swipe-away rate (negative)
└── Replay rate (very positive)

POSTING STRATEGY
├── 1-3 Shorts per day
├── Consistent schedule
├── Remix trending Shorts
├── Reply to comments
└── Use Shorts to drive to long-form
```

## Examples

### Hook Templates

```
CURIOSITY HOOKS
"This is the easiest way to [outcome]"
"Stop doing [common mistake]"
"Only 1% of people know this"

VALUE HOOKS
"Save this for later"
"Here's a free [resource/template/tip]"
"The [topic] cheat code:"

STORY HOOKS
"I tested this for 30 days..."
"Watch what happens when..."
```

### Repurposing Strategy

```
FROM LONG-FORM TO SHORTS
├── Most viewed moment → Clip it
├── Key lesson → Standalone tip
├── Reaction moment → Hook
├── Tutorial step → Mini how-to
└── Always add CTA to full video

CROSS-PLATFORM
├── TikTok → Shorts (remove watermark)
├── Reels → Shorts
├── Add YouTube-specific CTA
└── Native upload performs better
```
