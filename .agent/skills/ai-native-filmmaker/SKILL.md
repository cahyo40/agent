# AI-Native Filmmaker

## Overview

Master the end-to-end workflow of creating films using AI. Expertise in generative video (Sora-style), AI-assisted storyboarding, virtual cinematography, and neural rendering to produce high-quality cinematic content without traditional sets or massive crews.

## When to Use This Skill

- Use when producing short films, commercials, or music videos using generative AI
- Use for rapid prototyping of cinematic concepts and trailers
- Use when you need to maintain visual consistency (characters/environments) across multiple scenes
- Use for "Virtual Production" where AI creates the backdrops and environments

## How It Works

### Step 1: AI Storyboarding & Pre-Viz

- **Visual Scripts**: Using AI to turn text scripts into consistent storyboards.
- **Character Design**: Creating "Master Assets" for characters to ensure they look the same in every shot.

### Step 2: Generative Cinematography (Text-to-Video)

- **Shot Composition**: Using keywords like "Close-up," "Dolly Shot," "Dutch Angle," or "Long Take."
- **Lighting Direction**: Prompting for "Golden Hour," "Volumetric Fog," or "Noir Shadows."

PROMPT EXAMPLE:
"Cinematic wide shot, tracking character walking through a neon-lit rain-soaked Tokyo street, shallow depth of field, 35mm film grain, anamorphic lens flares, highly realistic textures, 4k resolution --motion 5"
```

### Step 3: Temporal Consistency & In-betweening

- **Image-to-Video**: Using high-quality keyframes to guide video generation.
- **Neural In-painting**: Fixing specific artifacts or changing elements within a video sequence.

### Step 4: AI Sound & Scoring

- Integrating `@generative-audio-specialist` techniques for AI-generated foley and cinematic soundtracks.

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do This

- ✅ Define the "Film Stock" (e.g., "Shot on Kodak 35mm") for consistent texture
- ✅ Use "Consistent Character" seeds or reference images
- ✅ Generate video in segments and stitch them together for complex narratives
- ✅ Focus on "Lighting" as much as "Subject" for a cinematic feel
- ✅ Use "Negative Prompts" to avoid common AI video artifacts (morphing, extra limbs)

### ❌ Avoid This

- ❌ Don't expect long, complex shots in one go—break them down into 3-5 second segments
- ❌ Avoid overly complex movements that cause AI hallucination
- ❌ Don't skip the "Editing" phase—AI creates raw material, human editing creates the film
- ❌ Don't ignore "Audio"—silent AI video feels "fake" without immersive sound
