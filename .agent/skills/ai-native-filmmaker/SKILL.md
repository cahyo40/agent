# AI Native Filmmaker

## Overview

This skill transforms you into a **Generative Cinema Creator**. You will master **AI Video Generation** (Sora, Runway, Pika), **AI Storyboarding**, **Virtual Cinematography**, and the **Prompt-to-Film Pipeline** to create professional-quality short films using AI tools.

## When to Use This Skill

- Use when creating short films with AI video generators
- Use when building AI-generated music videos
- Use when storyboarding before production
- Use when creating B-roll/stock footage with AI
- Use when compositing AI footage into live-action

## Part 1: The AI Filmmaking Pipeline

### 1.1 Traditional vs AI Pipeline

| Traditional | AI-Native |
|-------------|-----------|
| Script -> Storyboard -> Shoot -> Edit | Script -> Storyboard -> Prompt -> Generate -> Edit |

### 1.2 Key Stages

1. **Concept/Script**: Story, dialogue, scenes.
2. **Storyboarding (AI)**: Midjourney for key frames.
3. **Video Generation**: Runway/Sora for motion.
4. **Compositing**: After Effects for VFX.
5. **Sound Design**: Suno/Udio for music, ElevenLabs for voice.
6. **Editing**: Premiere/DaVinci for final cut.

## Part 2: AI Storyboarding

### 2.1 Frame-by-Frame Generation

Use Midjourney or DALL-E to create key frames for each scene.

**Prompt Template:**
`[Shot type], [Subject], [Action], [Location], [Lighting], [Mood], cinematic still, film grain --ar 16:9`

**Example:**
`Wide shot, lone astronaut walking on Mars surface, dust storm in distance, dramatic sunset lighting, melancholic mood, cinematic still, anamorphic lens --ar 2.39:1`

### 2.2 Shot Types Reference

| Shot | Use | Prompt Keyword |
|------|-----|----------------|
| **Wide/Establishing** | Set the scene | `wide shot, establishing shot` |
| **Medium** | Dialogue, action | `medium shot, waist up` |
| **Close-Up** | Emotion, detail | `close up, face detail` |
| **POV** | Immersion | `first person view, POV shot` |
| **Dutch Angle** | Tension, unease | `dutch angle, tilted camera` |

## Part 3: Video Generation Tools

### 3.1 Tool Comparison

| Tool | Strength | Weakness |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Runway Gen-3** | Motion, effects | Short clips (10s) |
| **Pika Labs** | Stylization | Less realistic |
| **Sora (OpenAI)** | Photorealism, physics | Access limited |
| **Kling (Kuaishou)** | Long shots, action | Regional access |

### 3.2 Prompting for Video

Structure: `[Camera Movement] [Subject] [Action] [Setting] [Style]`

**Example:**
`Slow dolly forward toward a woman sitting at a cafe, she looks up and smiles, Paris street in background, golden hour, cinematic film look, shallow depth of field`

### 3.3 Key Parameters

- **Camera Motion**: `static`, `dolly in`, `pan left`, `tracking shot`, `drone rising`.
- **Style**: `cinematic`, `documentary`, `vintage 8mm`, `anime`.
- **Duration**: Most tools do 4-10 seconds per clip.

## Part 4: Virtual Cinematography

### 4.1 Lighting Language

| Term | Visual | Use |
|------|--------|-----|
| **High Key** | Bright, minimal shadows | Comedy, happiness |
| **Low Key** | Dark, harsh shadows | Thriller, horror |
| **Golden Hour** | Warm, soft, sunset | Romance, nostalgia |
| **Neon/Practical** | Colored lights in scene | Cyberpunk, club |

### 4.2 Lens Simulation

- `anamorphic lens`: Horizontal flares, widescreen feel.
- `shallow depth of field`: Blurred background, focus on subject.
- `fish eye lens`: Distorted, extreme wide.

---

## Part 5: Audio Integration

### 5.1 AI Music Generation

- **Suno**: Text-to-song (with vocals).
- **Udio**: High-quality instrumental.

**Prompt Example:**
"Epic orchestral score, building tension, film trailer music, Hans Zimmer style"

### 5.2 AI Voice/Dialogue

- **ElevenLabs**: Clone voices, generate narration.
- **Sync Labs**: Lip sync AI for generated video.

## Part 6: Best Practices Checklist

### ✅ Do This

- ✅ **Maintain Visual Consistency**: Use seed locking or image-to-video for character consistency.
- ✅ **Plan Shots in Storyboard**: Don't prompt randomly. Know what you need.
- ✅ **Add Grain/Color Grade**: Unify AI clips with consistent post-processing.

### ❌ Avoid This

- ❌ **Expecting Perfect First Output**: Generate 10 variations, pick the best.
- ❌ **Ignoring Audio**: Sound is 50% of film. Don't use silence.
- ❌ **Ignoring Copyright**: Check tool TOS for commercial use rights.
