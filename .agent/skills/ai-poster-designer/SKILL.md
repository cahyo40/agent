# AI Poster Designer

## Overview

Master the art of creating impactful posters using AI. This skill focuses on "Design-First Prompting"—ensuring AI models leave room for text, respect visual hierarchy, and maintain consistent aesthetic styles (Minimalist, Retro, Neo-Futuristic, etc.).

## When to Use This Skill

- Use when preparing event posters, promotional materials, or film posters
- Use for guiding AI to create "text-ready" backgrounds
- Use when you need to combine specific imagery with high-impact typography
- Use for designing consistent series of posters for a campaign

## How It Works

### Step 1: Layout & Negative Space

- **Rule of Thirds**: Directing AI to place subjects in specific sectors to leave room for headings.
- **Negative Space Prompting**: Using keywords like "flat background," "copy space," or "minimalist top half" to ensure text readability.

### Step 2: Visual Hierarchy & Theme

- **Focal Point**: Ensuring the "Hook" of the poster is clear and unobstructed.
- **Color Palettes**: Using HSL/Hex keywords to ensure the poster matches brand guidelines.

### Step 3: Prompting for Posters

```text
PROMPT STRUCTURE:
[Subject] + [Style] + [Compositional Instructions for Text] + [Color/Lighting] + [Resolution/Aspect Ratio]
Example: "A futuristic cyberpunk city skyline, minimalist composition, bottom 30% left empty for text, deep neon blue and orange, 4k, cinematic lighting --ar 2:3"
```

### Step 4: Post-AI Refinement

- Integration with vector tools (Figma/Canva) to overlay high-quality typography over the AI-generated base.

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do This

- ✅ Specify the aspect ratio early (e.g., `--ar 2:3` for standard posters)
- ✅ Use keywords like "Poster Art," "Graphic Design Style," or "Vector Illustration"
- ✅ Request "Clean background" if you plan to add complex text later
- ✅ Test multiple composition variations (Left-heavy vs. Centered)
- ✅ Consider the distance from which the poster will be viewed (Bold details)

### ❌ Avoid This

- ❌ Don't let the AI generate its own text (usually garbled)—instead, ask for "No text"
- ❌ Avoid overly cluttered compositions that drown out the intended message
- ❌ Don't forget to define the "Vibe" (e.g., "Energetic," "Solemn," "Corporate")
- ❌ Don't use standard square ratios for posters unless intended for social media only
