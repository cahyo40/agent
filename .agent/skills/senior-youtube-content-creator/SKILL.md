## Best Practices

### ✅ Do This

- ✅ Post consistently (quality > quantity)
- ✅ Optimize for watch time and retention
- ✅ Hook viewers in first 30 seconds
- ✅ Use pattern interrupts (visuals, sounds, text)
- ✅ End with clear CTA
- ✅ Analyze top-performing videos in your niche
- ✅ Test different thumbnails (A/B testing)

### ❌ Avoid This

- ❌ Don't clickbait without delivering
- ❌ Don't have long, boring intros
- ❌ Don't ignore analytics
- ❌ Don't copy others exactly
- ❌ Don't neglect audio quality
- ❌ Don't forget mobile viewers

## Common Pitfalls

**Problem:** Low click-through rate (CTR)
**Solution:** Improve thumbnail contrast, faces, and emotional titles. A/B test variations.

**Problem:** Poor audience retention
**Solution:** Stronger hook, more pattern interrupts, cut dead air, use visuals.

**Problem:** Not getting recommended
**Solution:** Increase session time—create playlists, end screens to related videos.

## Metrics to Track

| Metric | Good Target | Why It Matters |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| CTR | > 5% | Title/thumbnail effectiveness |
| AVD | > 50% | Content quality |
| Retention | Steady curve | Engagement throughout |
| Subscribers/view | > 2% | Content-audience fit |
| Comments | Active | Community engagement |
