# Instructional Designer

## Overview

Design effective learning experiences using proven pedagogical methods. Covers curriculum design, lesson planning, module creation, and tutorial writing.

## When to Use This Skill

- Use when creating curriculum
- Use when designing lesson plans
- Use when setting learning objectives
- Use when creating learning modules
- Use when writing tutorials

## How It Works

### Step 1: ADDIE Model

```markdown
## Instructional Design Framework

### A - Analysis
- Who are the learners?
- What are their current skills?
- What do they need to learn?
- What constraints exist?

### D - Design
- Define learning objectives
- Sequence content
- Choose instructional strategies
- Plan assessments

### D - Development
- Create content materials
- Develop activities
- Build assessments
- Create instructor guides

### I - Implementation
- Pilot test
- Train instructors
- Deliver course
- Provide support

### E - Evaluation
- Collect feedback
- Measure outcomes
- Analyze results
- Revise and improve
```

### Step 2: Learning Objectives (SMART)

```markdown
## Writing Learning Objectives

### Bloom's Taxonomy Verbs

| Level | Verbs | Example |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Remember | List, define, recall | "List 5 principles of..." |
| Understand | Explain, describe, summarize | "Explain how X works" |
| Apply | Use, implement, solve | "Apply the formula to..." |
| Analyze | Compare, differentiate, examine | "Analyze the differences..." |
| Evaluate | Judge, critique, assess | "Evaluate the effectiveness..." |
| Create | Design, develop, produce | "Create a solution for..." |

### Objective Template
"By the end of this [lesson/module], learners will be able to 
[action verb] + [specific content] + [condition/context]"

### Example
"By the end of this module, learners will be able to 
CREATE a responsive website using HTML and CSS 
without referring to documentation."
```

### Step 3: Curriculum Framework

```text
CURRICULUM FRAMEWORK
├── LEARNING OBJECTIVES
│   └── What will learners be able to DO after?
│   └── Use Bloom's Taxonomy verbs
│
├── PREREQUISITE MAPPING
│   └── What must they know before?
│   └── Create skill dependency tree
│
├── MODULE STRUCTURE
│   ├── Phase 1: Fundamentals (20%)
│   ├── Phase 2: Core Concepts (40%)
│   ├── Phase 3: Advanced Topics (25%)
│   └── Phase 4: Projects (15%)
│
└── ASSESSMENT STRATEGY
    ├── Formative: Quizzes, exercises
    └── Summative: Projects, exams
```

### Step 4: Module Template

```markdown
# Module: [Topic Name]

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- [ ] Objective 1 (action verb + topic)
- [ ] Objective 2
- [ ] Objective 3

## Prerequisites
- Prerequisite 1
- Prerequisite 2

## Estimated Time
⏱️ 2-3 hours

---

## 1. Introduction
Brief overview and why this matters.

## 2. Core Concepts
### 2.1 Concept A
Explanation with examples.

### 2.2 Concept B
Explanation with examples.

## 3. Hands-On Practice
### Exercise 1: Basic
Step-by-step guided exercise.

### Exercise 2: Intermediate
Less guidance, more thinking.

## 4. Summary
- Key takeaway 1
- Key takeaway 2

## 5. Quiz
Test understanding before moving on.
```

### Step 5: Lesson Plan Template

```markdown
## Lesson Plan Structure

### Header
- Topic: [Subject]
- Duration: [Time]
- Target Audience: [Who]
- Prerequisites: [Required knowledge]

### Learning Objectives
1. [Objective 1]
2. [Objective 2]
3. [Objective 3]

### Lesson Flow
| Time | Activity | Method |
|------|----------|--------|
| 5 min | Hook/Intro | Story/Question |
| 15 min | Concept 1 | Lecture + Demo |
| 20 min | Practice | Hands-on |
| 10 min | Concept 2 | Discussion |
| 10 min | Assessment | Quiz/Exercise |

### Assessment
- Formative: [During lesson checks]
- Summative: [End assessment]
```

### Step 6: Learning Path Design

```text
LEARNING PATH: [Topic]
│
├── 🟢 BEGINNER (Week 1-2)
│   ├── Module 1: Introduction
│   ├── Module 2: Basic Concepts
│   └── Project: Hello World App
│
├── 🟡 INTERMEDIATE (Week 3-4)
│   ├── Module 3: Core Features
│   ├── Module 4: Best Practices
│   └── Project: CRUD Application
│
├── 🔴 ADVANCED (Week 5-6)
│   ├── Module 5: Advanced Patterns
│   ├── Module 6: Performance
│   └── Project: Full Application
│
└── 🎓 CAPSTONE
    └── Final Project: Real-world App
```

### Step 7: Engagement Strategies

```markdown
## Active Learning Techniques

### Think-Pair-Share
1. Think individually (2 min)
2. Pair with neighbor (3 min)
3. Share with class (5 min)

### Chunking Content
- 10-15 min content blocks
- Activity between chunks
- Recap after each chunk

### Scaffolding
- Start with guided practice
- Gradually reduce support
- End with independent practice
```

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do This

- ✅ Start with clear learning objectives
- ✅ Chunk content (15 min max)
- ✅ Use practical examples
- ✅ Include exercises after each concept
- ✅ Add troubleshooting sections

### ❌ Avoid This

- ❌ Don't lecture for too long
- ❌ Don't skip practice time
- ❌ Don't assume prior knowledge
- ❌ Don't make modules too long
