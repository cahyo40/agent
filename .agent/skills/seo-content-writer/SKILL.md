## How It Works

### Step 1: Understand Search Intent

Before writing, identify the search intent:

```

├── INFORMATIONAL (How to, What is, Guide)
│   └── Format: Long-form articles, tutorials, guides
│
├── NAVIGATIONAL (Brand name, Specific site)
│   └── Format: Landing pages, about pages
│
├── COMMERCIAL (Best, Review, Compare)
│   └── Format: Comparison posts, reviews, listicles
│
└── TRANSACTIONAL (Buy, Price, Discount)
    └── Format: Product pages, pricing pages
```

### Step 2: Structure Content for SEO

```

│   ├── Keep under 60 characters

│
├── INTRODUCTION (First 100 words)
│   ├── Hook the reader immediately
│   ├── Include primary keyword naturally

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do This

- ✅ Research keywords before writing
- ✅ Include primary keyword in first 100 words
- ✅ Use LSI (related) keywords naturally throughout
- ✅ Write for humans first, search engines second
- ✅ Make content scannable with headers and bullets
- ✅ Include internal links to related content (3-5 per 1000 words)
- ✅ Add external links to authoritative sources
- ✅ Optimize images with descriptive file names and alt text
- ✅ Keep paragraphs short (2-3 sentences max)
- ✅ Update content regularly with fresh information

### ❌ Avoid This

- ❌ Don't keyword stuff—sounds robotic and hurts rankings
- ❌ Don't write thin content (<300 words for articles)
- ❌ Don't duplicate content from other pages
- ❌ Don't use generic headers like "Introduction" or "Conclusion"
- ❌ Don't ignore search intent—mismatched content won't rank
- ❌ Don't skip meta descriptions—Google may generate poor ones
- ❌ Don't use walls of text without formatting
- ❌ Don't plagiarize or spin existing content

## Content Length Guidelines

| Content Type | Recommended Length | Notes |
|--------------|-------------------|-------|
| Blog Post (Informational) | 1,500-2,500 words | Match or exceed competitor average |
| Product Review | 1,000-2,000 words | Include specs, pros/cons, verdict |
| Comparison Post | 2,000-3,000 words | Cover all products thoroughly |
| How-To Guide | 1,500-3,000 words | Step-by-step with images |
| Pillar Content | 3,000-5,000+ words | Comprehensive topic coverage |
| Landing Page | 500-1,500 words | Focus on conversion, not length |

## Common Pitfalls

**Problem:** Content doesn't match search intent
**Solution:** Analyze top 10 results for target keyword. Match format, depth, and angle.

**Problem:** Keyword cannibalization (multiple pages targeting same keyword)
**Solution:** Consolidate similar content or differentiate focus. One page per primary keyword.

**Problem:** Content ranks but doesn't convert
**Solution:** Add clear CTAs, improve formatting, add trust signals, match user's journey stage.

**Problem:** Featured snippet stolen by competitor
**Solution:** Add a concise definition/answer early in content. Use lists and tables for visibility.
