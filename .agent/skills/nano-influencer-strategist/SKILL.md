```

### Step 2: Identify Quality Influencers

```
VETTING CHECKLIST
├── AUDIENCE QUALITY
│   ├── Real followers (check for fake/bot accounts)
│   ├── Audience demographics match your target
│   ├── Geographic location relevant
│   └── Engaged audience (not bought followers)
│
├── ENGAGEMENT METRICS
│   ├── Engagement rate: Likes + Comments / Followers
│   ├── Nano: 5%+ is good
│   ├── Micro: 3%+ is good
│   ├── Check comment quality (real conversations?)
│   └── Story views vs. follower count
│
├── CONTENT QUALITY
│   ├── Visual quality matches brand standards
│   ├── Authentic voice and style
│   ├── Previous brand partnerships natural
│   └── Content aligns with brand values
│
├── RED FLAGS (Avoid)
│   ├── Sudden follower spikes (bought followers)
│   ├── Generic/bot-like comments
│   ├── Low followers but following thousands
│   ├── Engagement pods (coordinated fake engagement)
│   └── Too many sponsored posts (over-commercialized)
│
└── VERIFICATION TOOLS
    ├── Social Blade (growth patterns)
    ├── HypeAuditor (fake follower check)
    ├── Modash (audience demographics)
    └── Manual scroll through comments/followers
```

### Step 3: Outreach Strategy

```
OUTREACH FRAMEWORK

│   ├── Follow and engage for 1-2 weeks
│   ├── Like and comment on their content
│   ├── Understand their content style
│   └── Note what products they already use
│
├── PERSONALIZED OUTREACH (DM or Email)
│   ├── Start with genuine compliment
│   ├── Explain why they're a fit
│   ├── Be clear about what you're offering
│   └── Make it easy to say yes
│
├── EMAIL TEMPLATE
│   ├── Subject: Collaboration with [Brand] 💜
│   ├── Intro: Who you are + why them specifically
│   ├── Offer: What you're proposing
│   ├── Value: What's in it for them
│   ├── CTA: Clear next step
│   └── Keep it short (150 words max)
│
└── FOLLOW-UP
    ├── Wait 5-7 days
    ├── Max 2 follow-ups
    ├── Add new value/context
    └── Accept no gracefully
```

## Measuring Campaign Success

| Metric | How to Track | Goal |
|--------|--------------|------|
| Engagement | Likes/comments on posts | >3% for micro |
| Reach | Impressions on content | ≥ follower count |
| Saves/Shares | Post insights | High = quality content |
| Clicks | UTM links | Track interest |
| Conversions | Promo codes | Direct ROI |
| UGC Quality | Review assets | Usable for ads |
| CPE | Spend / Engagements | <$1 for nano |

## Common Pitfalls

**Problem:** Influencers deliver but content quality is poor
**Solution:** Provide clearer briefs, share brand examples, request draft review before final submission.

**Problem:** No sales from influencer posts
**Solution:** Nano influencers build awareness, not direct sales. Use their content in paid ads for conversion.

**Problem:** Influencers ghost after receiving product
**Solution:** Use contracts with deadlines, stagger product shipping, require content before sending high-value items.

**Problem:** Finding enough quality nano influencers
**Solution:** Search branded hashtags, check competitor tagged photos, use discovery tools, ask customers directly.
