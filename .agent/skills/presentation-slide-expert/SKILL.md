## Part 1: Storytelling Frameworks

### 1.1 The Hero's Journey (Pitch Deck)

1. **The World (Status Quo)**: "Developers waste 10 hours/week on deployments."
2. **The Problem (Conflict)**: "Manual processes cause errors and delays."
3. **The Solution (Magic Weapon)**: "Our platform automates everything."
4. **The Transformation (New World)**: "Deploy in 5 minutes with zero errors."
5. **The Call to Action**: "Start your free trial."

### 1.2 The Minto Pyramid (Executive Summary)

Start with the **Answer**, then support with **Arguments**, then **Data**.

- **Slide 1**: "We recommend Plan A. It saves $2M and reduces risk."
- **Slide 2-4**: Why Plan A is better (3 supporting arguments).
- **Slide 5+**: The data behind each argument.

## Part 2: Slide Design Principles

### 2.1 One Idea Per Slide

If your slide needs a scroll bar or 8 bullet points, it's two slides.

### 2.2 Visual Hierarchy

1. **Title**: What's the takeaway? (Not "Q3 Results", but "Q3 Revenue Up 30%")
2. **Supporting Visual**: Chart, Image, or Diagram.
3. **Minimal Text**: Speaker notes are for details.

### 2.3 The 10-20-30 Rule (Guy Kawasaki)

- **10 slides** maximum.
- **20 minutes** to present.
- **30pt font** minimum (forces brevity).

## Part 3: Data Visualization

### 3.1 Chart Selection

| Data Type | Chart |
|-----------|-------|
| Trend over time | Line Chart |
| Comparison | Bar Chart |
| Part of whole | Pie Chart (max 5 slices) |
| Relationship | Scatter Plot |

### 3.2 Rules

- **Remove Chartjunk**: No 3D effects, no gradients, no gridlines if not needed.
- **Highlight the Story**: Use color to emphasize the key data point.
- **Title is the Insight**: "Sales Dropped 20% in Q3" not "Q3 Sales Chart".

## Part 4: AI-Assisted Slide Creation

### 4.1 Using LLMs for Outlines

**Prompt:**
"Create a 10-slide pitch deck outline for a SaaS product that automates invoice processing. Target audience: CFOs."

### 4.2 Image Generation (Midjourney/DALL-E)

**Prompt:**
"Minimalist illustration of a robot processing documents, isometric view, corporate blue palette, flat design, white background --ar 16:9"

### 4.3 Tools

- **Gamma.app**: AI generates slides from text.
- **Beautiful.ai**: Auto-layout slides.
- **Canva Magic Design**: Template suggestions.

## Part 6: Best Practices Checklist

### ✅ Do This

- ✅ **Rehearse with Slides**: Knowing your slides prevents fumbling.
- ✅ **Use Speaker Notes**: Put your script there, not on the slide.
- ✅ **Consistent Fonts/Colors**: Max 2 fonts, max 3 colors.

### ❌ Avoid This

- ❌ **Reading Slides Aloud**: If you're just reading, send a PDF instead.
- ❌ **Transitions/Animations**: Unless you're Steve Jobs, use "Cut" transition only.
- ❌ **Walls of Text**: If it's a paragraph, it's a document, not a slide.
