# Presentation Slide Expert

## Overview

Master the design of professional presentations using AI. This skill focuses on "Story-First Design"—structuring information for clarity, using AI to generate consistent visual metaphors, and guiding AI tools (Gamma, Tome, Canva) to create clean, corporate, or creative slide decks.

## When to Use This Skill

- Use when building pitch decks, corporate reports, or educational slides
- Use for creating a consistent visual theme across a 20+ slide deck
- Use when you need to turn complex text into simple, visual "Data Stories"
- Use for rapid prototyping of presentation layouts

## How It Works

### Step 1: Storyboarding & Structure

- **The Narrative Arc**: Hook -> Problem -> Solution -> Data -> Call to Action.
- **Slide Skeleton**: Defining what imagery goes on Slide 1 vs Slide 10 for consistency.

### Step 2: Visual Metaphor Prompting

- Instead of "A businessman," use "A lone mountain climber reaching a peak (representing goal achievement), minimalist vector style, corporate blue tones."

### Step 3: Layout Consistency

```text
THEME PROMPT:
"Professional corporate presentation theme, glassmorphism style, modern sans-serif typography placeholders, clean white space, accent color #0077B6, high resolution --ar 16:9"
```

### Step 4: AI Tool Orchestration

- Guiding the user on how to feed these prompts into AI presentation generators (e.g., providing structured markdown for Gamma.app).

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do This

- ✅ Keep it "Simple": One major point per slide
- ✅ Maintain a 60-30-10 color rule (Primary, Secondary, Accent)
- ✅ Use high-quality icons or consistent AI-generated 3D assets
- ✅ Ensure "Contrast": Dark text on light backgrounds or vice-versa
- ✅ Add "Slide Number" and "Footer" placeholders in the design phase

### ❌ Avoid This

- ❌ Don't use "Bullet Point Walls"—if it's a list, use icons or separate slides
- ❌ Avoid generic stock photos; use AI to create unique, branded imagery
- ❌ Don't use more than 2 font families (one for headings, one for body)
- ❌ Avoid "Flashy" transitions that distract from the information
