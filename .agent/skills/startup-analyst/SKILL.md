## How It Works

### Step 1: Market Sizing (TAM/SAM/SOM)

```
MARKET SIZING FRAMEWORK
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                                 │
│  TAM (Total Addressable Market)                                │
│  └── Everyone who could use this product                       │
│      Example: All smartphone users = $500B                     │
│                                                                 │
│  SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market)                          │
│  └── Segment you can realistically reach                       │
│      Example: Smartphone users in US = $150B                   │
│                                                                 │
│  SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market)                           │
│  └── What you can capture in 3-5 years                        │
│      Example: 5% of US market = $7.5B                          │
│                                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

CALCULATION METHODS:
├── Top-Down: Start with industry size, narrow down
├── Bottom-Up: Price × Customers × Frequency
└── Value Theory: Value created × Capture rate
```

### Step 2: Key SaaS Metrics

```
SAAS METRICS
├── REVENUE METRICS
│   ├── MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)
│   ├── ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue)
│   ├── ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)
│   └── Expansion Revenue (upsells, cross-sells)
│
├── GROWTH METRICS
│   ├── MoM Growth Rate
│   ├── CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)
│   ├── LTV (Lifetime Value)
│   └── LTV:CAC Ratio (target: 3:1+)
│
├── RETENTION METRICS
│   ├── Churn Rate (monthly/annual)
│   ├── Net Revenue Retention (target: 100%+)
│   └── Logo Retention
│
└── EFFICIENCY METRICS
    ├── Burn Multiple = Net Burn / Net New ARR
    ├── Rule of 40 = Growth Rate + Profit Margin
    └── Magic Number = Net New ARR / S&M Spend
```

### Step 3: Unit Economics

```markdown
## Unit Economics Calculator

**CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)**
= Total Sales & Marketing Spend / New Customers
= $100,000 / 200 = **$500**

**LTV (Lifetime Value)**
= ARPU × Gross Margin % × Avg Customer Lifespan
= $50/mo × 80% × 24 months = **$960**

**LTV:CAC Ratio**
= $960 / $500 = **1.92x** ⚠️ (target: 3x+)

**CAC Payback Period**
= CAC / (ARPU × Gross Margin)
= $500 / ($50 × 80%) = **12.5 months**
```

### Step 4: Competitive Analysis

```markdown
## Competitive Landscape

| Factor | Us | Competitor A | Competitor B |
|--------|-----|--------------|--------------|
| Pricing | $49/mo | $99/mo | $29/mo |
| Target Market | SMB | Enterprise | Prosumer |
| Key Differentiator | AI-powered | Integrations | Simplicity |
| Funding | Seed | Series C | Bootstrapped |

**Our Position:** Price-competitive with AI differentiation
**Key Threat:** Competitor B's simplicity appeal
**Opportunity:** Enterprise upsell path
```
