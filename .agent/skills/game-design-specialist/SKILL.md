# Game Design Specialist

## Overview

This skill transforms you into a **Game Systems Designer**. You will master **Core Loops**, **Systems Balancing**, **Player Psychology**, and **Narrative Design** for creating engaging game experiences.

## When to Use This Skill

- Use when designing game mechanics and systems
- Use when balancing economy and progression
- Use when creating player engagement loops
- Use when designing reward systems
- Use when writing game narratives

---

## Part 1: Core Game Loops

### 1.1 What Is a Core Loop?

The repeatable action cycle that drives gameplay.

```
Action -> Reward -> Upgrade -> Repeat
```

**Example (Clash Royale):**
Play Match -> Win Trophies/Cards -> Upgrade Cards -> Play Again

### 1.2 Loop Layers

| Layer | Timeframe | Example |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **Micro Loop** | Seconds | Tap to attack |
| **Core Loop** | Minutes | Complete a battle |
| **Meta Loop** | Hours/Days | Level up, unlock new content |
| **Elder Game** | Weeks/Months | Ranked seasons, prestige |

## Part 2: Player Psychology

### 2.1 Bartle's Player Types

| Type | Motivation | Design For |
|------|------------|------------|
| **Achiever** | Goals, completion | Achievements, leaderboards |
| **Explorer** | Discovery | Hidden content, lore |
| **Socializer** | Community | Guilds, chat, co-op |
| **Killer** | Competition | PvP, rankings |

### 2.2 Flow State (Csikszentmihalyi)

Balance challenge and skill.

- Too easy = Boredom.
- Too hard = Frustration.
- Just right = Flow.

### 2.3 Variable Reward Schedules

Randomized rewards are more engaging than fixed.

- **Gacha**: Random character pulls.
- **Loot Boxes**: Variable drops.
- **Critical Hits**: Random damage spikes.

## Part 3: Systems Balancing

### 3.1 Economy Design

| Resource | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Soft Currency** | Earned in-game (Gold) |
| **Hard Currency** | Purchased (Gems) |
| **Energy** | Limits sessions (Stamina) |
| **Progression** | XP, Levels |

### 3.2 Balancing Techniques

| Technique | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Spreadsheet Modeling** | Calculate curves, costs |
| **Playtesting** | Observe real players |
| **Data Analytics** | Track engagement metrics |
| **A/B Testing** | Compare variants |

### 3.3 Power Curves

```
Damage = BaseDamage * (1 + 0.1 * Level)
Cost = BaseCost * (1.15 ^ Level)
```

Exponential progression feels rewarding but must be capped.

## Part 4: Narrative Design

### 4.1 Environmental Storytelling

Tell story through world, not cutscenes.

- **Props**: A room tells a story (corpses, notes).
- **Architecture**: Ruined castle = past glory.
- **Audio**: Distant sounds imply events.

### 4.2 Player Agency

Let player make meaningful choices.

- **Branching Dialogue**: Different outcomes.
- **Moral Choices**: No "right" answer.
- **Consequences**: Choices have lasting impact.

### 4.3 Narrative Pacing

| Beat | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Hook | Grab attention (first 5 minutes) |
| Rising Action | Build tension |
| Climax | Peak challenge/revelation |
| Resolution | Reward, closure |

---

## Part 5: Monetization Design

### 5.1 Models

| Model | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Premium** | Pay once, own game |
| **Free-to-Play (F2P)** | Free with in-app purchases |
| **Subscription** | Monthly fee (Game Pass) |
| **Ad-Supported** | Watch ads for rewards |

### 5.2 Ethical F2P

- **No Pay-to-Win**: Spending money shouldn't give unfair advantage.
- **Fair Gacha Rates**: Disclose probabilities.
- **Spending Caps**: Protect players from overspending.

---

## Part 6: Best Practices Checklist

### ✅ Do This

- ✅ **Prototype Early**: Test mechanics before art.
- ✅ **Watch Players**: Observe, don't just ask.
- ✅ **Iterate Constantly**: Balance is never "done".

### ❌ Avoid This

- ❌ **Feature Creep**: Start with one great mechanic.
- ❌ **Pay-to-Win**: Destroys player trust.
- ❌ **Ignoring Onboarding**: First 5 minutes determine retention.
