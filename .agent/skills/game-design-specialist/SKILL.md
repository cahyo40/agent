# Game Design Specialist

## Overview

Master the art and science of game design. Expertise in core game loops, systems balancing, narrative design, levels, and understanding player psychology (Bartle taxonomy, flow state).

## When to Use This Skill

- Use when planning a new game project
- Use when balancing game difficulty or economy
- Use when writing game stories or dialogue
- Use when designing levels or progression systems

## How It Works

### Step 1: Core Loop & Mechanics

- **Primary Loop**: Action → Reward → Upgrade → Action.
- **Mechanics**: Defined rules for interaction (jumping, shooting, trading).
- **Dynamics**: How mechanics interact to create emergent behavior.

### Step 2: System Balance & Economy

```text
BALANCING CHECKLIST:
- Time to kill (TTK) vs. player survivability
- Resource scarcity vs. abundance
- Power curves (Linear vs. Exponential)
- Economy sinks (Cost of upgrades) vs. faucets (Rewards)
```

### Step 3: Narrative & Quest Design

- **Environmental Storytelling**: Telling stories through level design.
- **Branching Dialogues**: Consequences of player choices.
- **Character Archetypes**: Making memorable NPCs.

### Step 4: Player Psychology & Retention

- **Flow State**: Keeping difficulty perfectly balanced with skill level.
- **Juice**: Feedback loops (animations, sounds, effects) for satisfaction.
- **Motivation**: Using intrinsic (mastery) vs. extrinsic (looted items) rewards.

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do This

- ✅ Prototype early and often (Fail fast)
- ✅ Listen to playtester feedback objectively
- ✅ Document everything in a GDD (Game Design Document)
- ✅ Design for "Juice" and immediate feedback
- ✅ Balance for accessibility (difficulty settings, color-blind modes)

### ❌ Avoid This

- ❌ Don't start with content before solidifying the core loop
- ❌ Don't ignore the "First Time User Experience" (FTUE)
- ❌ Don't design in a vacuum (play other games)
- ❌ Don't make mechanics too complex for the audience
