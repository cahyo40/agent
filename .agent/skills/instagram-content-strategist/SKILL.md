## Common Pitfalls

**Problem:** Reels not getting views
**Solution:** Focus on stronger hooks, use trending audio, keep it shorter (15-30s to start), post at peak times.

**Problem:** Low engagement on posts
**Solution:** Add clear CTAs, ask questions, use carousels (swipeable = engagement), engage with your audience first.

**Problem:** Followers not converting to customers
**Solution:** Nurture through Stories, use CTA in bio, create educational content that builds trust, share testimonials.

**Problem:** Growth is stagnant
**Solution:** Audit content pillars, increase Reels frequency, collaborate with similar-sized accounts, engage in niche communities.
