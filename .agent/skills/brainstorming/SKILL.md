# Brainstorming

## Overview

Transform vague ideas into clear, actionable plans through structured creative thinking.

## When to Use This Skill

- Use before designing new features
- Use when exploring solution options
- Use when facing complex problems
- Use when the user has vague requirements

## How It Works

### Step 1: Problem Framing

```markdown
## Problem Framing Canvas

### 1. WHAT is the problem?
[Clear, specific statement in one sentence]

### 2. WHO is affected?
- Primary users: [who]
- Secondary stakeholders: [who]
- Systems impacted: [what]

### 3. WHY does it matter?
- Business impact: [revenue, cost, efficiency]
- User impact: [pain points, frustration]
- Urgency: [timeline pressure]

### 4. WHAT constraints exist?
- Time: [deadline]
- Budget: [resources available]
- Technology: [stack limitations]
- Skills: [team capabilities]

### 5. WHAT does success look like?
- Metric 1: [measurable outcome]
- Metric 2: [measurable outcome]
- Definition of done: [criteria]
```

### Step 2: Ideation Techniques

```markdown
## Divergent Thinking (Generate Ideas)

### "How Might We..." Questions
- HMW make [task] faster?
- HMW make [experience] more enjoyable?
- HMW reduce [friction point]?
- HMW help users [achieve goal]?

### Reverse Brainstorming
"How could we make this WORSE?"
→ Then flip each answer to find solutions

### Analogies
"How does [other industry] solve this?"
- Uber → on-demand anything
- Netflix → subscription model
- Amazon → one-click purchasing

### 10x Thinking
"If we had unlimited resources, what would we build?"
→ Then scale back to MVP

### SCAMPER Method
- Substitute: What can we replace?
- Combine: What can we merge?
- Adapt: What can we copy from elsewhere?
- Modify: What can we change?
- Put to other uses: New applications?
- Eliminate: What can we remove?
- Reverse: What if we did the opposite?
```

### Step 3: Idea Prioritization

```markdown
## Impact vs Effort Matrix

           HIGH IMPACT
                │
    Quick Wins  │  Big Bets
    (Do First)  │  (Plan Carefully)
                │
────────────────┼────────────────
                │
    Fill-ins    │  Time Sinks
    (Do Later)  │  (Avoid)
                │
           LOW IMPACT
    LOW EFFORT ─────── HIGH EFFORT

## RICE Scoring

| Idea | Reach | Impact | Confidence | Effort | Score |
|------|-------|--------|------------|--------|-------|
| A    | 1000  | 3      | 80%        | 2w     | 120   |
| B    | 500   | 2      | 90%        | 1w     | 90    |
| C    | 2000  | 1      | 50%        | 3w     | 33    |

Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort

## MoSCoW Prioritization

- **Must Have**: Critical for launch
- **Should Have**: Important but not critical
- **Could Have**: Nice to have
- **Won't Have**: Out of scope (for now)
```

### Step 4: Solution Validation

```markdown
## Quick Validation Checklist

### Feasibility
- [ ] Can we build this with current tech?
- [ ] Do we have the skills?
- [ ] Is the timeline realistic?

### Viability
- [ ] Does it solve the real problem?
- [ ] Will users pay/use this?
- [ ] Is ROI positive?

### Desirability
- [ ] Do users actually want this?
- [ ] Have we validated with real users?
- [ ] Does it fit user workflows?

## Assumption Testing

| Assumption | Risk Level | How to Test | Result |
|------------|------------|-------------|--------|
| Users want X | High | Survey | TBD |
| Tech can handle Y | Medium | Prototype | TBD |
| Market exists | High | Competitor research | TBD |
```

### Step 5: Action Planning

```markdown
## Next Steps Template

### Immediate (This Week)
- [ ] Validate assumption X
- [ ] Create quick prototype
- [ ] Get 5 user interviews

### Short-term (This Sprint)
- [ ] Build MVP core feature
- [ ] Set up analytics
- [ ] Get initial feedback

### Medium-term (This Month)
- [ ] Iterate based on feedback
- [ ] Add supporting features
- [ ] Prepare for launch

### Success Metrics
- North Star: [primary metric]
- Leading indicator: [early signal]
- Health metric: [sustainability check]
```

### Step 6: Creative Prompts

```markdown
## When You're Stuck

### Perspective Shifts
- "What would [competitor] do?"
- "What would a beginner expect?"
- "What would make this 10x simpler?"
- "What if we had to launch in 1 day?"

### Constraint Removal
- "What if cost wasn't a factor?"
- "What if we ignored legacy systems?"
- "What if we started from scratch?"

### User-Centric
- "What's the user doing before/after using this?"
- "What's the user's real goal?"
- "What would delight the user?"

### Patterns
- "What's the simplest version that works?"
- "What's the 80/20 solution?"
- "What's already working that we can extend?"
```

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do This

- ✅ Separate ideation from evaluation
- ✅ Encourage wild ideas first
- ✅ Build on others' ideas ("Yes, and...")
- ✅ Document ALL options
- ✅ Use visual tools (diagrams, maps)
- ✅ Time-box brainstorming sessions
- ✅ Include diverse perspectives

### ❌ Avoid This

- ❌ Don't criticize during ideation
- ❌ Don't jump to first solution
- ❌ Don't ignore constraints
- ❌ Don't skip user validation
- ❌ Don't over-engineer before validating
