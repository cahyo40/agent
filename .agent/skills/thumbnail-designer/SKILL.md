## Overview

Design click-worthy thumbnails that maximize video CTR.

## When to Use This Skill

## How It Works

### Step 1: Thumbnail Anatomy

```markdown
## High-CTR Elements

### Face
- Clear emotion (surprise, shock, joy)
- Eye contact with viewer
- At least 30% of frame

### Text
- 3-4 words max
- Large, bold font
- Contrasting color

### Background
- Bright, saturated colors
- Simple, uncluttered
- Contrasts with YouTube red UI
```

### Step 2: Color Psychology

```markdown
## Colors that Pop

|-------|---------|---------|
| Yellow | Attention | Highlights, text |
| Red | Urgency | Warnings, drama |
| Blue | Trust | Tech, tutorials |
| Green | Growth | Money, success |
| Orange | Energy | Action, CTA |

## Avoid

```

### Step 3: Design Template

```markdown
## Thumbnail Composition

[Face/Subject] | [Text] | [Supporting Visual]
     40%       |  35%   |        25%

### Text Placement
- Top-right or bottom-left
- Never over face

```
