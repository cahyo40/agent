# Thumbnail Designer

## Overview

Master the art of the "Click." This skill focuses on the psychology of attention—using high-contrast colors, expressive AI-generated faces, "Z-Pattern" layouts, and bold, readable typography to maximize Click-Through Rate (CTR) for video content.

## When to Use This Skill

- Use when creating thumbnails for YouTube, TikTok, or Reels
- Use for A/B testing different visual hooks with AI-generated variations
- Use when you need to "Stop the Scroll" in a crowded feed
- Use for designing branding for video series with AI consistency

## How It Works

### Step 1: Eye-Catching AI Imagery

- **Expressive Faces**: Prompting AI for "exaggerated facial expressions" (Shock, Awe, Success) to create an immediate emotional connection.
- **Micro-Detailing**: Using keywords like "8k," "highly detailed texture," or "macro photography" to make the subject "Pop" on small screens.

### Step 2: The "Z-Pattern" Layout

- Placing the most important element (Face/Product) where the eye starts (top-left/right), and the "Value Prop" (Text) in the remaining focal path.

### Step 3: Contrast & Color Theory for CTR

```text
PROMPT STRATEGY:
"Main subject in foreground, highly detailed, vibrant colors, bokeh background in complementary color (e.g., Orange vs Blue), neon rim light, sharp focus, 8k --ar 16:9"
```

### Step 4: Text Overlay Strategy

- Using bold, high-contrast typography (3-4 words max) that complements the AI-generated imagery.

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do This

- ✅ Use "Complementary Colors" for the subject vs. background (e.g., Blue background for an Orange subject)
- ✅ Ensure the subject occupies at least 40% of the thumbnail frame
- ✅ Test visibility at 10% size to ensure readability on mobile devices
- ✅ Use "Neon Rim Lights" in prompts to separate the subject from the background
- ✅ Keep the right-center area clear (where the timestamp/duration often covers)

### ❌ Avoid This

- ❌ Don't use small text—it becomes unreadable on mobile
- ❌ Avoid "False Advertising" (Clickbait that doesn't deliver) to maintain viewer trust
- ❌ Don't clutter the image with too many competing elements
- ❌ Don't use low-contrast color schemes (e.g., Grey on Black)
