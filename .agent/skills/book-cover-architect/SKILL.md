## Part 1: Genre Conventions (Visual Signals)

Readers judge genre in 0.5 seconds. Match their expectations.

| Genre | Visual Elements | Color Palette |
|-------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Thriller** | Dark, silhouettes, isolated figures | Black, Red, Cold Blue |
| **Romance** | Couples, embracing poses, soft focus | Pink, Red, Warm tones |
| **Sci-Fi** | Space, tech, cities, helmets | Blue, Neon, Metallic |
| **Fantasy** | Castles, swords, magic, cloaked figures | Purple, Gold, Deep Blue |
| **Business/Non-Fiction** | Bold text, minimal imagery | White, Black, one accent |
| **Self-Help** | Bright, hopeful, nature/sunrise | Yellow, Orange, Teal |

## Part 2: Composition Techniques

### 2.1 The "Big Text" Approach

For well-known authors: Author name is the hero (Stephen King style).

- Name: 50%+ of cover space.
- Image: Subtle background texture.

### 2.2 The "Hero Image" Approach

For debut authors: Image tells the story.

- Image: 70% of cover.
- Title: Integrated into composition.

### 2.3 The Rule of Thirds

Place key elements (face, title) on the intersection points of a 3x3 grid.

## Part 3: Typography for Books

### 3.1 Title Font Selection

| Genre | Font Style | Example |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Thriller | Bold Sans-Serif, Distressed | DIN Condensed, Bebas Neue |
| Romance | Script, Elegant Serif | Great Vibes, Playfair Display |
| Sci-Fi | Futuristic, Geometric | Orbitron, Eurostile |
| Fantasy | Decorative, Blackletter | Cinzel, Uncial Antiqua |

### 3.2 Readability at Thumbnail Size

Amazon thumbnails are ~100px wide. If you can't read the title, redesign.

---

## Part 4: AI Image Generation for Covers

### 4.1 Prompt Structure

`[Subject], [Mood], [Style], [Lighting], [Composition], [Negative Space for Title]`

**Example (Thriller):**
`A silhouette of a man standing in a foggy alley, noir atmosphere, cinematic lighting, high contrast, dark and moody, top half empty for title placement --ar 2:3 --v 6`

### 4.2 Leaving Space for Title

Critical: Generate images with "top third empty" or "blurred background area" for title overlay.
Add to prompt: `large negative space at top for text overlay`.

## Part 5: Print vs Digital Considerations

### 5.1 Spine Design

- For books < 100 pages: Spine may be too thin for text.
- For books > 200 pages: Include Title, Author Name, Publisher Logo.

### 5.2 Back Cover

- **Blurb**: 150 words max.
- **Author Photo**: Optional but adds trust.
- **Barcode**: Required for ISBN.
- **Testimonials/Reviews**: Social proof.

### 5.3 eBook Only

- Design for RGB (screen), not CMYK (print).
- Thumbnail clarity is king.

## Part 6: Best Practices Checklist

### ✅ Do This

- ✅ **Research Bestsellers**: Browse Amazon Top 100 in your genre. Note the patterns.
- ✅ **Test at Thumbnail Size**: Shrink to 100px. Is title readable?
- ✅ **Series Consistency**: Same font, layout, and color scheme across all books.

### ❌ Avoid This

- ❌ **Clip Art**: Screams "amateur".
- ❌ **Too Many Elements**: One strong focal point beats five competing ones.
- ❌ **Wrong Genre Signals**: A pink cursive title on a crime thriller confuses buyers.
