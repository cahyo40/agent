## Part 1: Dynamic Composition

### 1.1 The Action Pose

Static poses are boring. Capture peak action:

- **Football**: Mid-kick, ball leaving foot.
- **Basketball**: Dunk at apex, fingers on rim.
- **MMA**: Punch landing, sweat spray.

### 1.2 Diagonal Lines

Diagonals = Energy.
Tilt the camera, have the athlete's body at an angle.
Horizontal = stable. Diagonal = dynamic.

### 1.3 Cropping for Intensity

Crop tight. Cut off edges of limbs to imply motion beyond the frame.

---

## Part 2: Motion & Speed Effects

### 2.1 Motion Blur

Apply directional blur to background, keep subject sharp.

- Photoshop: Radial Blur (Zoom) on background layer.
- AI Prompt: `speed lines, motion blur in background`.

### 2.2 Particle Effects

Add drama with:

- **Sparks**: Fire sports, MMA.
- **Water Droplets**: Swimming, rain games.
- **Dust/Turf Spray**: Football, baseball slides.

### 2.3 Light Trails

Neon or colored light streaks following the ball or fist trajectory.

---

## Part 3: Dramatic Lighting

### 3.1 Rim Lighting

Light from behind the subject creates a glowing edge, separating them from background.

- AI Prompt: `cinematic rim lighting, backlit`.

### 3.2 Stadium Lights

Harsh overhead lights with lens flare for authenticity.

- AI Prompt: `stadium lighting, lens flare, night game atmosphere`.

### 3.3 Color Grading

| Mood | Treatment |
|------|-----------|
| Intense/Aggression | Orange and Teal (Hollywood standard) |
| Victory/Glory | Golden hour warm tones |
| Night Game | Cool blues with hot highlights |

## Part 4: AI Image Generation for Sports

### 4.1 Prompt Structure

`[Athlete] in [Action Pose], [Sport], [Lighting], [Effects], [Style]`

**Example:**
`A soccer player mid-volley kick, freezeframe moment, stadium lights in background, motion blur on legs, dramatic rim lighting, hyper-realistic sports photography --ar 4:5 --v 6`

### 4.2 Common Issues

- **Anatomy errors**: AI often struggles with hands/feet in action poses. Inpaint to fix.
- **Ball physics**: Ball position may look unnatural. Composite a real ball.

---

## Part 5: Text & Branding

### 5.1 Typography

- **Bold, condensed sans-serif**: Impact, Anton, Bebas Neue.
- **All caps**: Aggressive, commanding.
- **Slight skew/italic**: Matches dynamic composition.

### 5.2 Team Branding

- Use team colors as primary palette.
- Include logo (sponsor or team crest).
- Match date/time format to local conventions.

### 5.3 VS Layouts (Matchday)

- Two athletes facing each other.
- "VS" in the center, largest element.
- Date/Time at bottom.

## Part 6: Best Practices Checklist

### ✅ Do This

- ✅ **Use High-Res Athlete Photos**: Low-res cutouts look amateur.
- ✅ **Match Lighting Direction**: If light comes from left on athlete, background should match.
- ✅ **Add Subtle Texture**: Grunge/noise overlay adds grit.

### ❌ Avoid This

- ❌ **Clashing Colors**: Team colors vs background should have contrast.
- ❌ **Overcrowded Layouts**: One hero athlete/moment per poster.
- ❌ **Static Poses**: Action sports need action.
