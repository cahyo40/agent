# Sports Poster Specialist

## Overview

Master the creation of high-impact sports posters. This skill focuses on "Action-Driven Prompting"—capturing the raw energy of athletes, using dynamic lighting (Chiaroscuro, Neon rim lights), and implementing specialized sports effects like motion blur, particles, and turf/dirt splatters.

## When to Use This Skill

- Use when creating promotional materials for athletes, teams, or sporting events
- Use for "Game Day" social media graphics
- Use when you need to emphasize movement, speed, or raw physical power
- Use for designing sports merchandise or collectible card art

## How It Works

### Step 1: Capturing Motion

- **Freeze Frame vs. Blur**: Using keywords like "action shot," "mid-air leap," or "dynamic motion blur."
- **Energy Elements**: Adding "shattering glass," "lightning sparks," or "swirling smoke" to amplify the intensity.

### Step 2: Dramatic Lighting

- **Rim Lighting**: Using "colored rim light" (e.g., team colors) to separate the athlete from the background.
- **Volumetric Lighting**: Using "stadium floodlights," "hazy atmosphere," or "dust motes" for depth.

### Step 3: Sports Composition

```text
PROMPT EXAMPLE (Basketball):
"Pro basketball player dunking, aggressive pose, low angle shot, sweat dripping, wooden court floor, stadium lights in background, rim light neon orange, high speed photography, cinematic particles, 8k --ar 4:5"
```

### Step 4: Team Branding

- Incorporating team colors via prompt keywords (e.g., "Deep Emerald and Gold color scheme").

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do This

- ✅ Use "Low angle" (Frog's eye view) to make the athlete look heroic/larger than life
- ✅ Add texture keywords like "Canvas texture," "Gritty," or "Distressed" for a "street" sports look
- ✅ Prompt for specific equipment details (e.g., "Carbon fiber texture on jersey")
- ✅ Use high-contrast color grading (Deep blacks, vibrant highlights)
- ✅ Focus on the eyes and facial expression of the athlete for emotional impact

### ❌ Avoid This

- ❌ Don't use "Static" or "Standing" poses unless it's a formal portrait
- ❌ Avoid flat lighting—it kills the energy of a sports poster
- ❌ Don't forget the environment (The court, the field, the ring)
- ❌ Avoid generic "sport" prompts—be specific (e.g., "Left hook boxing punch")
