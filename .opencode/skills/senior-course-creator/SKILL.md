## How It Works

### Step 1: Curriculum Design

```
CURRICULUM FRAMEWORK
├── LEARNING OBJECTIVES
│   └── What will learners be able to DO after?
│   └── Use Bloom's Taxonomy verbs
│
├── PREREQUISITE MAPPING
│   └── What must they know before?
│   └── Create skill dependency tree
│
├── MODULE STRUCTURE
│   ├── Phase 1: Fundamentals (20%)
│   ├── Phase 2: Core Concepts (40%)
│   ├── Phase 3: Advanced Topics (25%)
│   └── Phase 4: Projects (15%)
│
└── ASSESSMENT STRATEGY
    ├── Formative: Quizzes, exercises
    └── Summative: Projects, exams
```

### Step 2: Module Template

```markdown
# Module: [Topic Name]

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- [ ] Objective 1 (action verb + topic)
- [ ] Objective 2
- [ ] Objective 3

## Prerequisites
- Prerequisite 1
- Prerequisite 2

## Estimated Time
⏱️ 2-3 hours

## 1. Introduction
Brief overview and why this matters.

## 2. Core Concepts
### 2.1 Concept A
Explanation with examples.

### 2.2 Concept B
Explanation with examples.

## 3. Hands-On Practice
### Exercise 1: Basic
Step-by-step guided exercise.

### Exercise 2: Intermediate
Less guidance, more thinking.

## 4. Real-World Example
Practical application with code.

## 5. Summary
- Key takeaway 1
- Key takeaway 2
- Key takeaway 3

## 6. Quiz
Test understanding before moving on.

## 7. Next Steps
What to learn next.
```

### Step 3: Tutorial Structure

```markdown
## Tutorial: [How to Build X]

### What You'll Build
[Screenshot or demo of final result]

### Prerequisites
- Tool A installed
- Basic knowledge of X

### Time Required
⏱️ 30 minutes

---

### Step 1: Setup
```bash
npm create vite@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm install
```

**What this does:** Creates a new project...

### Step 2: Create Component

```jsx
// src/App.jsx
export function App() {
  return <h1>Hello</h1>;
}
```

**Why:** We start with a simple component...

### Step 3: Add Functionality

[Continue with clear steps...]

### Troubleshooting

**Error:** "Module not found"
**Solution:** Run `npm install` again

### Next Steps

- Try adding feature X
- Explore related topic Y
