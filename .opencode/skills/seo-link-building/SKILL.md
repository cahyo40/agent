## Examples

### Example 1: Guest Post Outreach Email

```
SUBJECT: Quick question about [Site Name]

Hi [First Name],

I've been following [Site Name] for a while now—your recent article 
on [specific topic] was really insightful, especially the part about 
[specific detail that shows you read it].

I noticed you occasionally publish guest content and wanted to see 
if you'd be interested in a piece from me. I'm [your name], [brief 
credential—e.g., "founder of X" or "10-year SEO veteran"].

Here are a few topic ideas that might resonate with your audience:

1. [Topic 1] - Why this would help their audience
2. [Topic 2] - Angle or unique perspective
3. [Topic 3] - Fresh take on popular subject

I'd write something original, well-researched, and tailored to your 
style. Happy to share some of my previous work if helpful.

Let me know if any of these spark interest—or if there's another 
topic you'd prefer!

Best,
[Your Name]
[Your Website]
```

### Example 2: Broken Link Building Email

```
SUBJECT: Found a broken link on your [page topic] page

Hi [First Name],

I was reading your excellent resource on [topic] 
([URL of their page]) and noticed that one of your links appears 
to be broken:

→ [Anchor text] links to [broken URL] (now showing 404)

Since you curate great resources for your readers, I thought you'd 
want to know. 

If you're looking for a replacement, I recently published a 
comprehensive guide on [topic]: [Your URL]

It covers [briefly what it covers], which might be a good fit for 
your readers.

Either way, just wanted to give you a heads up about the broken link!

Best,
[Your Name]
```

### Example 3: HARO Response Template

```
WHAT: Response to: "[Query Title]"

SOURCE: [Publication Name] - [Journalist Name]

Hi [Journalist First Name],

[Direct answer to their question in 2-3 sentences]

[Supporting detail or example from your experience]

[Relevant statistic or data point if applicable]

---

ABOUT ME:
[Your Name]
[Title], [Company]
[One-sentence credential relevant to this query]
[Website URL]
[LinkedIn URL - optional]

Happy to provide additional context or answer follow-up questions!

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do This

## Metrics & Tracking

| Metric | Target | Purpose |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Outreach Response Rate | 10-15% | Email quality check |
| Link Acquisition Rate | 3-5% of outreach | Campaign effectiveness |
| Average Link DR/DA | 30+ | Link quality |
| Referring Domains Growth | ↑ Monthly | Overall progress |
| Organic Traffic Growth | ↑ Quarterly | Business impact |

## Common Pitfalls

**Problem:** Low outreach response rates
**Solution:** Improve personalization, research recipients better, test subject lines, ensure you're reaching the right person.

**Problem:** Getting links but no ranking improvement
**Solution:** Check link quality (relevance, authority), ensure proper anchor text diversity, verify links aren't nofollow or blocked.

**Problem:** Outreach emails going to spam
**Solution:** Warm up email domain, avoid spam trigger words, use proper DKIM/SPF/DMARC, keep links minimal in outreach.

**Problem:** Running out of link opportunities
**Solution:** Expand to adjacent niches, look internationally, focus on creating more linkable assets, try digital PR.
