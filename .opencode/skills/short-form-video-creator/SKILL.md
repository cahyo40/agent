# Short-Form Video Creator

## Overview

Create engaging short-form videos optimized for TikTok, Reels, and Shorts.

## When to Use This Skill

- Use when creating TikTok/Reels content
- Use when repurposing long content to short

## How It Works

### Step 1: Platform Specs

```markdown
## Video Specifications

| Platform | Ratio | Duration | Size |
|----------|-------|----------|------|
| TikTok | 9:16 | 15s-10min | 1080x1920 |
| Reels | 9:16 | 15s-90s | 1080x1920 |
| Shorts | 9:16 | 15s-60s | 1080x1920 |

## Safe Zones
- Top: 150px (username/follow)
- Bottom: 270px (caption/buttons)
- Sides: 30px padding
```

### Step 2: Hook Formulas

```markdown
## First 3 Seconds (CRITICAL)

### Pattern Interrupts
- "Stop scrolling if you..."
- "Nobody talks about this..."
- "The trick they don't want you to know..."

### Question Hooks
- "Why does nobody..."
- "What if I told you..."
- "Did you know that..."

### Visual Hooks
- Quick movement/transition
- Unexpected visual
- Text overlay with bold claim
```

### Step 3: Content Structure

```markdown
## AIDA for Short-Form

### Attention (0-3s)
Hook + Pattern interrupt

### Interest (3-15s)
Story/Problem setup

### Desire (15-45s)
Solution/Value

### Action (45-60s)
CTA (follow, comment, share)

## Retention Tricks
- Change visuals every 2-3s
- Use captions (85% watch muted)
- Add sound effects
- End with open loop
```

### Step 4: Trending Audio Strategy

```markdown
## Sound Strategy

### Finding Trending Sounds
1. Check "For You" page daily
2. Look for arrow icon (trending)
3. Save sounds with < 10K uses

### Original Audio Benefits
- Higher reach potential
- Brand recognition
- Can go viral independently

### Music Selection

```
