│   └── "If we [change], then [metric] will [improve]"
│
├── 2. DESIGN
│   └── Single variable, measurable, time-bound
│
├── 3. RUN (1-2 weeks usually)
│   └── Track primary + guardrail metrics
│
├── 4. ANALYZE
│   └── Statistical significance
│

```
WAITLIST GAMIFICATION
─────────────────────────────────
1. Sign up → Get position #5,234
2. Share unique link
3. Each referral → Move up +100 spots
4. Top 100 → Early access
