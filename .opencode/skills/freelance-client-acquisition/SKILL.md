## How It Works

### Step 1: Define Your Ideal Client Profile (ICP)

```
IDEAL CLIENT PROFILE
├── COMPANY CHARACTERISTICS
│   ├── Industry/niche (be specific)
│   ├── Company size (employees, revenue)
│   ├── Stage (startup, growth, enterprise)
│   └── Geography (if relevant)
│
├── DECISION MAKER
│   ├── Title/role (who hires you?)
│   ├── Goals and KPIs
│   ├── Common pain points

│
├── PROJECT CHARACTERISTICS
│   ├── Budget range (minimum + sweet spot)

├── GOOD FIT SIGNALS
│   ├── They value quality over cheapest price
│   ├── Clear project goals
│   ├── Responsive communication

│
└── RED FLAG SIGNALS
    ├── "We need it yesterday"
    ├── Vague scope, precise (low) budget
    ├── Decision by committee (slow)
    ├── Haggling before understanding value
    └── "We'll give you exposure"
```

### Step 2: Lead Generation Channels

```

### Step 3: Cold Outreach Framework

```
COLD OUTREACH STRUCTURE
├── RESEARCH FIRST (5-10 min per prospect)
│   ├── Understand their business
│   ├── Find a relevant hook
│   ├── Identify specific problem you solve
│   └── Find the right person to contact

├── EMAIL STRUCTURE
│   ├── SUBJECT: Short, specific, curiosity
│   │   └── "[Specific observation] + question"
│   │
│   ├── OPENER: Personalized hook
│   │   └── Reference their work/content
│   │
│   ├── VALUE: What you can do for them
│   │   └── Focus on outcomes, not services
│   │
│   ├── PROOF: Brief credibility
│   │   └── Similar client result
│   │
│   └── CTA: Low-friction ask
│       └── "Worth a quick chat?"
│
├── FOLLOW-UP SEQUENCE
│   ├── Day 3: Add new value/angle
│   ├── Day 7: Check if helpful
│   ├── Day 14: Final attempt
│   └── Max 4 emails, then stop
│
└── TIMING
    ├── Tuesday-Thursday best
    ├── 8-10 AM or 2-4 PM

## Examples

### Example 1: Cold Email Template

```
SUBJECT: Quick question about [their company]'s website

Hi [First Name],

I noticed [specific observation about their business—e.g., 
"your recent product launch on ProductHunt"]. Congrats on 
[specific achievement]!

While checking out [company], I noticed [specific opportunity 
or problem—e.g., "your landing page could better highlight 
your core differentiator"].

I help [type of company] [outcome—e.g., "increase trial 
signups by improving their website conversion"]. For example, 
I recently helped [similar client] achieve [specific result].

Would it be worth a 15-minute call to see if I could help?

Best,
[Your Name]
[One-line signature: what you do]

P.S. [Optional: specific insight or free tip related to 
their situation]
```

### Example 2: Follow-Up Sequence

```markdown
EMAIL 1 (Initial outreach)
[Main cold email as above]

EMAIL 2 (Day 3 - Bump with value)
───────────────────────────────────────────
Subject: Re: Quick question about [company]'s website

Hi [Name],

Following up on my previous note. I was thinking more 
about [company] and wanted to share one quick idea:

[One specific, actionable suggestion they can use immediately]

Just thought it might be helpful. Happy to discuss further 
if you're interested.

Best,
[Your Name]

EMAIL 3 (Day 7 - Check relevance)
───────────────────────────────────────────
Subject: Re: Quick question about [company]'s website

Hi [Name],

I know timing isn't always right. Is [topic you help with] 
a priority for [company] right now?

If so, I'd love to connect. If not, no worries at all—
feel free to reach out whenever it makes sense.

Best,
[Your Name]

EMAIL 4 (Day 14 - Final follow-up)
───────────────────────────────────────────
Subject: Closing the loop

Hi [Name],

I'll assume the timing isn't right and close this loop.

If [pain point] ever becomes a priority, I'm here to help. 
Just reply to this thread.

Best of luck with [company]!

[Your Name]
```

Really enjoyed [specific detail]. Would love to connect!


MESSAGE 1 (After connection accepted)

Hey [Name], thanks for connecting!

I saw your recent post about [topic]. [Brief thoughtful 
comment or question about it.]

I specialize in [your service] and work with [type of 
company] like yours. Just curious—is [pain point] 
something you're dealing with currently?


MESSAGE 2 (If interested)
───────────────────────────────────────────
Great to hear! I've helped companies like [example] with 
exactly that.

Would a quick 15-minute call make sense to see if I 
could help? Here's my calendar: [link]


MESSAGE 3 (If no response after 5 days)
───────────────────────────────────────────
Hey [Name], totally understand if you're busy. If 
[pain point] becomes a priority, I'd love to help.

Either way, happy to stay connected!

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do This

- ✅ Personalize every outreach (no templates without customization)
- ✅ Focus on their problems, not your services
- ✅ Lead with value, not with a sales pitch
- ✅ Follow up consistently (most deals close after 4th touch)
- ✅ Qualify prospects before writing proposals
- ✅ Ask for referrals from happy clients
- ✅ Track your outreach in a CRM/spreadsheet
- ✅ Set aside dedicated prospecting time weekly
- ✅ Niche down (specialist > generalist)
- ✅ Build relationships before pitching

### ❌ Avoid This

- ❌ Don't send mass copy-paste outreach
- ❌ Don't lead with your resume
- ❌ Don't compete mainly on price
- ❌ Don't write proposals without discovery calls
- ❌ Don't ghost after a proposal
- ❌ Don't burn bridges (industries are small)
- ❌ Don't undercharge to get experience
- ❌ Don't rely on one channel only

## Outreach Metrics to Track

| Metric | Target | What It Tells You |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Emails sent | 20-50/week | Activity level |
| Open rate | >50% | Subject line quality |
| Reply rate | 5-15% | Message quality |
| Positive replies | 25-50% of replies | Offer relevance |
| Calls booked | 10-20% of contacts | CTA effectiveness |
| Close rate | 25-50% of calls | Sales/positioning |

## Common Pitfalls

**Problem:** Low response rates to cold outreach
**Solution:** More personalization. Better targeting. Stronger hook. Test subject lines.

**Problem:** Calls but no closes
**Solution:** Improve discovery process. Address objections. Maybe pricing is off.

**Problem:** Feast or famine cycles
**Solution:** Prospect consistently even when busy. Build referral engine. Create inbound content.

**Problem:** Attracting low-budget clients
**Solution:** Change positioning. Raise prices. Improve portfolio. Target bigger companies.
