# No-Code Builder

## Overview

Build applications without coding using visual development platforms.

## When to Use This Skill

- Use for rapid prototyping
- Use when non-developers need to build apps

## How It Works

### Step 1: Platform Selection

```markdown
## No-Code Platforms

### Web Apps
- **Bubble** - Full-featured web apps
- **Webflow** - Marketing sites
- **Softr** - Airtable-powered apps
- **Glide** - Spreadsheet to app

### Databases
- **Airtable** - Spreadsheet + database
- **Notion** - Docs + database
- **Supabase** - Backend as service

### Automation
- **Zapier** - Connect apps
- **Make** - Advanced workflows
- **n8n** - Self-hosted automation

### Mobile
- **Adalo** - Native mobile apps
- **FlutterFlow** - Flutter without code
- **Thunkable** - Cross-platform
```

### Step 2: Bubble Basics

```markdown
## Bubble Architecture

### Data Types
Define your data structure:
- User (email, name, role)
- Product (name, price, image)
- Order (user, products, total)

### Workflows
Visual event handlers:
- When button clicked → Create new Order
- When page loads → Search for Products
- When input changes → Filter results

### Repeating Groups
Display lists of data:
- Data source: Search for Products
- Layout: Fixed or responsive grid
- Each cell shows: Product Name, Price, Image
```

### Step 3: Airtable + Softr

```markdown
## Airtable as Backend

### Base Structure
Projects (Table)
├── Name (Text)
├── Status (Single Select)
├── Assigned To (Link to Users)
├── Due Date (Date)
└── Attachments (Attachment)

### Views
- Grid View: All data
- Kanban: By status
- Calendar: By due date
- Gallery: Visual cards

## Softr Frontend
- Connect Airtable base
- Create pages with blocks
- User auth (Airtable Users)
- Conditional visibility
```

### Step 4: Webflow for Marketing

```markdown
## Webflow Workflow

### Design
- Visual canvas (like Figma)
- Flexbox/Grid layouts
- Responsive breakpoints
- Interactions & animations

### CMS
- Collections (Blog, Products, Team)
- Dynamic pages
- Filter and sort

### Hosting
- Built-in hosting
- Custom domains
- SSL included
- CDN global
```

### Step 5: When to Use No-Code

```markdown
## Good Fit ✅
- MVPs and prototypes
- Internal tools
- Marketing sites
- Simple CRUD apps
- Landing pages

## Bad Fit ❌
- Complex algorithms
- Real-time apps
- High scalability needs
- Custom integrations
- Performance-critical
```

## Best Practices

- ✅ Start with clear requirements
- ✅ Plan data structure first
- ✅ Use native integrations
- ❌ Don't over-engineer
- ❌ Don't ignore platform limits
