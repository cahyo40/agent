## Best Practices

### ✅ Do This

- ✅ Keep NAP 100% consistent across all platforms
- ✅ Add photos regularly (weekly if possible)
- ✅ Post updates on GBP at least weekly
- ✅ Respond to every review within 48 hours
- ✅ Build citations on relevant industry directories
- ✅ Use location-specific landing pages for multi-location
- ✅ Include schema markup (LocalBusiness) on website
- ✅ Monitor and remove duplicate listings
- ✅ Encourage reviews through ethical methods

### ❌ Avoid This

- ❌ Don't keyword-stuff business name on GBP
- ❌ Don't use a PO Box for service-area businesses
- ❌ Don't ignore negative reviews
- ❌ Don't buy fake reviews (will get caught)
- ❌ Don't create multiple GBP listings for same location
- ❌ Don't use call tracking numbers on GBP
- ❌ Don't neglect updating hours for holidays
- ❌ Don't use stock photos (authenticity matters)

## Local SEO Ranking Factors

| Factor | Weight | Focus Areas |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Google Business Profile | High | Completeness, activity, reviews |
| On-Page Signals | High | NAP, local keywords, schema |
| Review Signals | High | Quantity, quality, velocity, diversity |
| Link Signals | Medium | Local backlinks, authority |
| Citation Signals | Medium | Accuracy, consistency, volume |
| Behavioral Signals | Medium | CTR, mobile clicks-to-call, check-ins |
| Personalization | Low | User history, location |

## Common Pitfalls

**Problem:** Multiple GBP listings for same business
**Solution:** Merge duplicates through Google's duplicate resolution process. Keep the listing with more reviews.

**Problem:** Poor review velocity (too few new reviews)
**Solution:** Implement systematic review request process. Ask happy customers at point of sale/service completion.

**Problem:** Ranking in wrong city/area
**Solution:** Create location-specific pages, build local citations, earn links from local sources.

**Problem:** GBP suspended
**Solution:** Review Google's guidelines, remove any policy violations, submit reinstatement request with documentation.
