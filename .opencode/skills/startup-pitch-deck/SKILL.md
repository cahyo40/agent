### Step 2: Storytelling Framework

```
INVESTOR NARRATIVE ARC
├── ACT 1: THE HOOK (Problem)
│   ├── Start with relatable pain point
│   ├── Quantify the problem
│   ├── Create urgency ("Why now?")
│   └── Goal: Make them care
│
├── ACT 2: THE JOURNEY (Solution + Proof)
│   ├── Reveal your solution elegantly
│   ├── Show it working (traction)
│   ├── Demonstrate market opportunity
│   └── Goal: Build credibility
│
└── ACT 3: THE VISION (Future + Ask)
    ├── Paint the big picture
    ├── Show clear path to success
    ├── Make the ask
    └── Goal: Create excitement

STORYTELLING TIPS:
- Start with a story, not data
- Use "you" language (make investor feel the problem)
- Every slide answers "So what?"
- End each slide with forward momentum
```

### Step 3: Market Sizing (TAM/SAM/SOM)

```
MARKET SIZING METHODS
├── TOP-DOWN APPROACH
│   ├── Start with industry size
│   ├── Narrow to your segment
│   └── Example:
│       TAM: $50B global e-learning
│       SAM: $5B professional online courses
│       SOM: $500M project management courses
│
├── BOTTOM-UP APPROACH (More Credible)
│   ├── Start with your unit economics
│   ├── Multiply by reachable customers
│   └── Example:
│       $200/user × 2.5M potential users = $500M SOM
│
└── PRESENT CLEARLY
    ├── TAM: Total if you dominated everything
    ├── SAM: Realistic addressable portion
    ├── SOM: What you can capture in 3-5 years
    └── Show sources for credibility
```

### Step 4: Financial Projections

| Year | Revenue | Expenses | Net | Key Driver |
|------|---------|----------|-----|------------|
| Y1 | $100K | $150K | -$50K | Launch + first customers |
| Y2 | $500K | $400K | $100K | Product-market fit |
| Y3 | $2M | $1.5M | $500K | Scale sales |
| Y4 | $6M | $4M | $2M | Market expansion |
| Y5 | $15M | $10M | $5M | Category leader |

**Key Metrics to Include:**

- MRR/ARR growth
- Customer acquisition cost (CAC)
- Lifetime value (LTV)
- LTV:CAC ratio (>3:1 is healthy)
- Gross margin
- Burn rate and runway

## Examples

### Example 1: Problem Slide Copy

```markdown
❌ BAD: Generic and Vague
"Small businesses struggle with marketing."

✅ GOOD: Specific and Compelling

THE PROBLEM

80% of local businesses fail within 5 years.

The #1 reason? They can't compete with big brands 
on digital advertising.

- Average small business has 2 hours/week for marketing
- Google Ads cost $50+ per lead in most industries
- They're losing $10,000+/year on ineffective campaigns

"I know I need to be online, but I don't have time 
or money to figure it out." — Sarah, bakery owner
```

### Example 2: Traction Slide

```markdown
TRACTION

📈 Revenue Growth
$0 → $50K MRR in 8 months (180% MoM average)

👥 User Metrics
- 2,500 active users
- 45% month-over-month growth
- 85% retention rate

🏆 Key Milestones
✓ Mar 2024: Product launch
✓ Jun 2024: First $10K MRR
✓ Sep 2024: 100 paying customers
✓ Nov 2024: Partnership with [Notable Company]

💼 Notable Customers

### Example 3: Use of Funds

```markdown
THE ASK

Raising $1.5M Seed Round

USE OF FUNDS
├── 50% Product Development
│   ├── Hire 3 senior engineers
│   └── Accelerate roadmap
│
├── 30% Go-to-Market
│   ├── Sales team (2 AEs)
│   └── Paid acquisition tests
│
└── 20% Operations
    ├── Infrastructure
    └── Working capital

18-MONTH MILESTONES
□ $500K ARR
□ 50 enterprise customers

```

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do This

- ✅ Keep it to 10-15 slides maximum
- ✅ One idea per slide
- ✅ Use visuals over text (graphs, icons)
- ✅ Tell a story, not a data dump
- ✅ Start with the problem, not your solution
- ✅ Show traction if you have it
- ✅ Be honest about risks and challenges
- ✅ Know your numbers cold
- ✅ Design for clarity, not beauty
- ✅ Practice until you can present without slides

### ❌ Avoid This

- ❌ Don't use walls of text
- ❌ Don't include hockey stick projections without logic
- ❌ Don't claim "no competition"
- ❌ Don't put everything in the deck (save for Q&A)
- ❌ Don't use jargon or buzzwords
- ❌ Don't make the ask too early
- ❌ Don't hide weaknesses (VCs will find them)
- ❌ Don't use generic stock photos
- ❌ Don't exaggerate metrics

## Deck Design Principles

```
DESIGN GUIDELINES
├── TYPOGRAPHY
│   ├── Title: 36-48pt, bold
│   ├── Body: 24-28pt
│   ├── Max 2 font families
│   └── Sans-serif preferred
│
├── COLORS
│   ├── 2-3 colors maximum
│   ├── One accent for emphasis
│   ├── White/light backgrounds
│   └── Dark text for readability
│
├── LAYOUT
│   ├── Consistent margins
│   ├── Plenty of white space
│   ├── Align elements to grid
│   └── Logo on every slide (small)
│
└── VISUALS
    ├── Real product screenshots
    ├── Simple graphs (no 3D)
    ├── Icons over bullets
    └── Team photos (professional)
```

## Common Pitfalls

**Problem:** Deck is too long
**Solution:** Cut to 10-12 slides for first send. Save details for appendix or follow-up.

**Problem:** No clear ask
**Solution:** State exact amount, use of funds, and what milestones you'll reach.

**Problem:** Weak problem statement
**Solution:** Interview customers. Use their words. Quantify the pain.

**Problem:** Unrealistic projections
**Solution:** Build bottom-up from unit economics. Explain assumptions. Be conservative.

## Pitch Deck for Different Stages

| Stage | Focus | Slides | Key Proof |
|-------|-------|--------|-----------|
| Pre-seed | Vision + Team | 8-10 | Founder credibility |
| Seed | Traction + Market | 10-12 | Early metrics |
| Series A | Scalability + GTM | 12-15 | Clear path to $10M+ |
| Series B+ | Financials + Market Position | 15+ | Profitability path |
