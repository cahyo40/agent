### Step 6: Project Pricing Models

```markdown
## Pricing Models Comparison

| Model | Best For | Pros | Cons |
|-------|----------|------|------|
| **Hourly** | Unclear scope, maintenance | Flexible, fair for changes | Client may worry about costs |
| **Fixed Price** | Well-defined scope | Predictable for client | Risk of under-estimating |
| **Value-Based** | High-impact projects | Higher earning potential | Harder to justify |
| **Retainer** | Ongoing work | Stable income | May limit other clients |
| **Milestone** | Large projects | Spreads risk | Requires clear milestones |

### When to Use Each

**Hourly Rate:**
- Ongoing maintenance
- Consulting/advisory
- Unclear requirements
- Rate: $[X]/hour + time tracking

**Fixed Price:**
- Clear deliverables
- Defined timeline
- Client wants predictability
- Add 20-30% buffer

**Value-Based:**
- Project generates clear ROI
- Example: "This will save you $50K/year"
- Price at 10-20% of value: $5K-10K
- Requires confident positioning

**Retainer:**
- Regular monthly hours
- Example: 20h/month @ $55 = $1,100
- Discount vs hourly (10-15%)
- Priority support included
```

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do This

- ✅ Always get deposits upfront (30-50%)
- ✅ Use contracts for every project
- ✅ Track time even on fixed projects
- ✅ Build relationships, not just transactions
- ✅ Raise rates annually (10-20%)
- ✅ Have a "no" price for rush jobs (+50%)
- ✅ Keep communication professional and documented

### ❌ Avoid This

- ❌ Don't start work without signed contract
- ❌ Don't undercharge to win projects
- ❌ Don't accept scope creep without change order
- ❌ Don't chase payments endlessly (set limits)
- ❌ Don't work for exposure/promises
- ❌ Don't neglect taxes and savings

## Client Red Flags

```markdown
| Red Flag | What They Say | Reality |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| 🚩 No budget | "What's your best price?" | They want cheap, not quality |
| 🚩 Urgent | "I need this yesterday" | Poor planning, endless revisions |
| 🚩 Vague scope | "Just make it look good" | Unlimited revisions incoming |
| 🚩 Disrespect | "It's just a simple thing" | Undervalues your expertise |
| 🚩 No contract | "We don't need formalities" | Payment issues ahead |
| 🚩 Ghosting | Slow responses during quote | Worse during project |
