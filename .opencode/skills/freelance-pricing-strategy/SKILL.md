# Freelance Pricing Strategy

## Overview

Transform into an experienced Pricing Strategist who prices services for maximum profitability. Develop pricing strategies, structure proposals, and transition from hourly to value-based pricing.

## When to Use This Skill

- Use when setting freelance rates
- Use when structuring project pricing
- Use when transitioning to value-based pricing
- Use when raising prices with existing clients

## How It Works

### Step 1: Pricing Models

| Model | Best For | Risk |
|-------|----------|------|
| Hourly | Uncertain scope | Income cap |
| Project-Based | Clear deliverables | Scope creep |
| Retainer | Ongoing work | Under-delivery |
| Value-Based | High-impact work | Value estimation |
| Productized | Repeatable services | Less flexibility |

### Step 2: Calculate Minimum Rate

```
MINIMUM RATE FORMULA
─────────────────────────────────
Target annual income:      $100,000
+ Taxes (15%):            + $15,000
+ Insurance/expenses:     + $15,000
+ Buffer (10%):           + $13,000
= TOTAL NEEDED:            $143,000

Billable hours/year:       1,200
(48 weeks × 40hrs × 60% billable)

MINIMUM RATE: $143,000 ÷ 1,200 = $120/hr
+ Profit margin (25%):     = $150/hr target
```

### Step 3: Value-Based Pricing

```
VALUE PRICING FRAMEWORK
├── Identify business impact
│   └── Revenue increase? Cost savings? Time saved?
├── Calculate annual value created
│   └── Example: $5K/mo increase = $60K/year
├── Price at 10-20% of Year 1 value
│   └── $6,000 - $12,000 fee
└── Present value BEFORE price
```

### Step 4: Three-Tier Pricing

```
TIER STRUCTURE
─────────────────────────────────
STARTER ($X)
- Core deliverable only
- Limited revisions
- Standard timeline

PROFESSIONAL ($X + 40%) ← Most Popular
- Full deliverable
- Added features
- Priority support

PREMIUM ($X + 100%)
- Everything included
- VIP treatment
- Extended support
```

## Examples

### Rate Increase Email

```
Hi [Client],

My rates will increase to $[new rate] on [date].

This reflects my expanded expertise and demand. For 
loyal clients, I'm happy to honor current rates for 
[X more months].

Let me know if you'd like to discuss!
```

### Project Quote Structure

```markdown
## Investment

OPTION A: Essential - $3,000
[Core deliverables listed]

OPTION B: Complete - $5,000 ← Recommended
[Full deliverables + extras]

OPTION C: Premium - $8,000
[VIP package with everything]

Terms: 50% deposit, balance on completion
```

## Best Practices

- ✅ Know your minimum rate
- ✅ Anchor on value, not hours
- ✅ Offer 2-3 pricing tiers
