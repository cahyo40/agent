UX WRITING PRINCIPLES
├── CLARITY
│   └── Users should understand immediately
│   └── No jargon, no ambiguity
│
├── CONCISENESS
│   └── Every word must earn its place
│   └── Shorter is usually better
│
├── USEFULNESS
│   └── Tell users what to do next
│   └── Provide actionable guidance
│
└── VOICE
    └── Consistent brand personality
    └── Human, not robotic
```

### Step 2: Button Labels

```markdown
## Button Copy Best Practices

### ❌ Vague
- "Submit"
- "OK"
- "Click Here"
- "Yes/No"

### ✅ Specific & Action-Oriented
- "Create Account"
- "Save Changes"
- "Send Message"
- "Delete Project" / "Keep Project"

### Format: [Verb] + [Object]
- "Add to Cart"
- "Download PDF"
- "Schedule Meeting"
- "Start Free Trial"
```

### Step 3: Error Messages

```markdown
## Error Message Formula

### Structure:
1. What happened (briefly)
2. Why it happened (if helpful)
3. How to fix it

### ❌ Bad Error Messages
- "Error 500"
- "Invalid input"
- "Something went wrong"
- "Forbidden"

### ✅ Good Error Messages
- "That email is already registered. Try logging in or use a different email."
- "Password must be at least 8 characters. Add 2 more characters."
- "We couldn't save your changes. Check your connection and try again."
- "You don't have access to this page. Contact your admin for permission."
```

### Step 4: Empty States & Onboarding

```markdown
## Empty State Copy

### Structure:
1. What this area is for
2. Why it's empty (if not obvious)
3. Clear CTA to get started

### Example:
**Heading:** No projects yet
**Body:** Projects help you organize your work. Create your first one to get started.
**CTA:** Create Project

## Onboarding Copy

### Step 1: Welcome
"Welcome to [App]! Let's set up your workspace in 2 minutes."

### Step 2: Value Prop
"First, let's create your first [thing]. This is where you'll [benefit]."

### Step 3: Quick Win
"Great! You just created your first [thing]. 🎉"

### Step 4: Next Step
"Next, try [feature] to [benefit]."
```

### Step 5: Confirmation & Success

```markdown
## Confirmation Dialogs

### ❌ Vague
"Are you sure?"

### ✅ Clear
"Delete 'Project Alpha'? This can't be undone."
- [Cancel] [Delete Project]

---

## Success Messages

### Keep them brief but warm:
- "Saved!" ✓
- "Message sent"
- "Welcome aboard! Check your email to get started."
- "Payment successful. Receipt sent to your email."
```
